#âœ… 2. String Indexing & Slicing

#Python treats strings like lists of characters:

word = "Python"
print(word[0])  # P
print(word[1])  # y
print(word[-1]) # n (last character)
#ðŸŽ¯ Slicing

print(word[0:3])   # Pyt (from index 0 to 2)
print(word[:4])    # Pyth (start to 3)
print(word[2:])    # thon (from index 2 to end)
