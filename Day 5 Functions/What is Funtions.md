ðŸ§  DAY 5 â€“ MASTERING PYTHON FUNCTIONS

ðŸ”¥ Learn it like you're explaining it to your future team.

ðŸ”¹ What Is a Function?

Think of a function like a coffee machine:

    You put in inputs (water, coffee)

    Press a button (run the function)

    You get output (coffee)

In code:

    A function groups logic together

    You can run it whenever you want

    It helps keep your code clean, readable, and reusable

ðŸŽ¯ Real-Life Examples of Functions:

Real World Function-like Action

Calculator You press +, it runs code
Phone You call a number (input), it connects (process)
Google You type search (input), get results (output)
